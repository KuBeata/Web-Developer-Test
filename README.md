# Web-Developer-Test

There are two tasks completed. As I am not familiar with PHP and SQL, I could not complete Task 3.

There was a confusing part in Style Guide on Figma:
There are three states of Input style: Normal, Focus and Hover. For me it looks like visualisation of Focus and Hover states are mislabled.
So I switched features of those states in my code.
